# **$RAD — The Meme Coin With a Ledger**

📖 *The Ledger’s most loyal believer*  
⚡ *Powered by XRPL*  
🧾 *Where the meme meets accountability*

---

# **Identity**

$RAD isn’t a joke token  
It’s a **ledger-first identity**  
A brand built on accountability, verification, and signal

It exists for one purpose:

### **To bring order, clarity, and verification to XRPL.**  
The RAD Ledger — a public index of verified, certified, and unverified XRPL projects — is the backbone of this mission.

$RAD is the meme coin that **doesn’t hide**  
It doesn’t beg  
It doesn’t chase  
It **documents**  

A meme with a ledger is a meme with teeth.

# **The RAD Ledger — Purpose**

The RAD Ledger was built to clean up the ecosystem:

### ✔ Filter the noise  
### ✔ Expose the trash  
### ✔ Highlight real builders  
### ✔ Give the XRPL a source of truth  
### ✔ Keep scammers uncomfortable  
### ✔ Give projects a place to be verified or certified  

It’s a growing registry of:

- Verified tokens  
- Certified developers  
- Rug reports  
- NFT certifications  
- Blacklisted wallets  
- Project grouping  
- Accuracy checks  
- Full XRPL project categorization  

This is **the first real attempt** to map the XRPL transparently —  
using culture, identity, and a meme character with conviction.

Markets swing  
Narratives shift  
Pretenders disappear

The ledger remains  
Final  
Fast

$RAD was built on that principle  
Not hype — **protocol**

# **Tokenomics — 70 / 20 / 10 Model**

Fuel for:
- Airdrops  
- OTC allocations  
- Community tools  
- Ledger development  
- Growth cycles  

### **🟣 Reserve — 20% (200B RAD)**  
Long-term positioning:

### **🟢 Liquidity — 10% (100B RAD)**  
AMM seed only  
Paired with XRP  
Never sold  
Permanent depth  

This structure keeps $RAD aligned with the XRPL, not against it.
